caption: 'This work was given to a team of six women: Jean Jennings, Marlyn Wescoff, Ruth Lichterman, Betty Snyder, Frances Bilas, and Kay McNulty. World War II left the United States with a shortage of male engineers. As such, the Army posted job descriptions for women “computers,” who would calculate artillery trajectories by hand. These six women were selected out of a group of “computers” to work on a top-secret project.'
